# Badges

This app allows you to add content badges to an ecommerce. In the Admin panel, you can create, edit and remove badges. There is also a storefront component that allows these badges to be added to your store theme.

## Setup

In order to setup **Badges** in your store, follow these steps:

1. Install the app. You can do this by going to the [Badges app page](https://apps.vtex.com/vtex-badges/p) in the VTEX app store or by running this command in your terminal:
```bash
  vtex install vtex.badges@3.x
```
2. Add **Badges** to the `peerDependencies` in your `manifest.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "vtex.badges": "3.x"
}
```

With this, you should be able to start using the app.

## Managing badges

After installing the app you will be able to access it by going to the `OTHER` section of the Admin panel and clicking `Badge Management`.

```diff
  "store.product": {
    "children": [
+     "store-badges",
      "stack-layout",
      "breadcrumb",
      "flex-layout.row#main",
      "condition-layout.product"
    ]
  },

+  "store-badges":{
+    "props": {
+      "numberOfBadges": 1,
+      "text":{
+        "font": "t-heading-5",
+        "textColor": "blue",
+        "textAlignment": "CENTER",
+        "textPosition": "CENTER",
+        "htmlId": "teste1"
+      },
+      "image":{
+        "blockClass": "container",
+        "height": 500,
+        "width": 500,
+         "minWidth": 25,
+         "minHeight": 25,
+         "alt": "teste",
+         "title": "title",
+         "preload": true
+      }
+    }
+  }

```
